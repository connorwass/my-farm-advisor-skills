# R2 Seed Pipeline

## Intent

Keep this skill tiny and operational:

- Seed baseline files from this skill’s `src/` into live storage at `data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/`
- Preserve live data across reboot/redeploy
- Use simple, auditable `rsync` commands only

Live data always wins unless you explicitly run the upgrade command.

---

## Paths

- **Seed source (repo):** `skills/my-farm-advisor/r2-seed-pipeline/src/`
- **Live destination (container runtime):** `/data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/`
- **Live destination (local dev checkout):** `data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/`

> `/data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/` inside the container.
> `data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/` when mounted via bind volume.

## Commands (exact)

### 0) Provision runtime environment (once per host)

```bash
cd skills/my-farm-advisor/r2-seed-pipeline
./scripts/install.sh
```

This creates `/data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/r2-seed-pipeline/.venv` (or the
path specified via `R2_SEED_DATA_ROOT`). The pipeline entrypoints also run this
installer automatically when the venv is missing. Activate it manually with

```bash
source /data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/r2-seed-pipeline/.venv/bin/activate
```

Run all pipeline scripts from that environment.

### 1) Safe Seed (append only, never overwrite)

```bash
rsync -r --no-times --ignore-existing \
  "skills/my-farm-advisor/r2-seed-pipeline/src/" \
  "/data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/"
```

Behavior:

- Copies only missing files
- Does **not** overwrite existing files
- Does **not** delete anything

### 2) Upgrade Seed (overwrite changed files, no delete)

```bash
rsync -r --no-times --checksum \
  "skills/my-farm-advisor/r2-seed-pipeline/src/" \
  "/data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/"
```

Behavior:

- Updates destination files when contents differ
- Creates missing files
- Does **not** delete anything (no `--delete`)

---

## Why these flags

- `-r` recursive copy
- `--no-times` required for s3fs/R2 mounts (timestamp writes are unreliable)
- `--ignore-existing` for additive safe seed
- `--checksum` for content-based upgrade behavior

---

## Minimal layout expectation

`src/` should mirror canonical runtime shape under `data/my-farm-advisor/`, e.g.:

```text
src/
├── growers/
├── shared/
└── scripts/
```
